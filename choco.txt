# install Linux Subsystem from choco
# turn on Linux Subsystem in Windows features
# Developer mode -> On
# bash (netherless admin)
# it will go installation (and hangs as for me, but it seems after successfull finish)
# bash turned on to Ubuntu Bash
# run with admin
# proxy: modify /etc/apt/apt.conf as in website above (Acquire and so on)

# Bash
# adduser user
# usermod -aG sudo user
# PowerShell
# lxrun /setdefaultuser user

# Terminal looks ugly from standard cmd
# Let's go with cmder
# http://cmder.net/

# I set shortcut at the Desktop to Ctrl-Alt-T
# to call 'cmder.bat "bash ~"'
# not default cmder.bat (through choco seems I have no .bat)
# but my .bat seems nearly the same as official

# To add "Run bash here" I use this:
# https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/60125-open-bash-window-here-context-menu-add-windows-10-a.html
# The only way I found to succeed was to run PowerShell->Cmder->Bash
# (I don't like Bash or PowerShell->Bash because default terminal window is ugly)
# (But I have no luck with only Cmder->Bash)

# Let's go =D
# install a lot into Windows Linux Subsystem =)
