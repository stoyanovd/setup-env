0. PowerDesigner is installed.

0,5. PowerDesigner Repository is initialized:
there is some wizard, that create database, there all PD info is stored.
In my case it is MS SQL Server database.


-- Connection to repo

1. Create user (!) ODBC connect (x32 is ok) to MS SQL Server (in my case) PowerDesigner database
I have some problems with 'system' connection.

2. Login with ADMIN user, after that create new user in Repo section (you will be prompt for new password after relogin)

3. In Repo->Admininstration->Groups double click leads to menu, there you can add your new user to Admin group.


-- Java
In case you have problems with 'Could not initialize JavaVM'
set up java (jre),
and set up System env, according to this url
http://sybase.public.powerdesigner.general.narkive.com/xsK2vFdO/error-could-not-initialize-javavm

copy of message from this url:

Solution: It appears that PowerDesigner requires 32bit JRE!!!
1) In menu Tools > General Options > Variables set variable JAVA to location of your java.exe (e.g. c:\java\jre6\bin\java.exe)
2) Add path to file jvm.dll to you PATH system variable (e.g. c:\java
\jre6\bin\client)
3) Create system variable CLASSPATH (if not exists) and add JDBC driver
for your database with full path into it (e.g. c:\drivers\jdbc\ojdbc14.jar)
