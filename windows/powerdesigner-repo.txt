0. PowerDesigner is installed.

0,5. PowerDesigner Repository is initialized:
there is some wizard, that create database, there all PD info is stored.
In my case it is MS SQL Server database.


-- Connection to repo

1. Create user (!) ODBC connect (x32 is ok) to MS SQL Server (in my case) PowerDesigner database
I have some problems with 'system' connection.

2. Login with ADMIN user, after that create new user in Repo section (you will be prompt for new password after relogin)

3. In Repo->Admininstration->Groups double click leads to menu, there you can add your new user to Admin group.
