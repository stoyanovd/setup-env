Important points:
- install things in right order
- check versions of tools, you need the same major version

### 1. Install MS SQL Server

Download and install free version of MS SQL Server  
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads

### 5. Run SSMS

You need run as Administrator to connect to IS



# Iteration II

### 1. Postgresql

We need ODBC driver for postgresql. Let's install the whole postgres.
Check installation of both x32 and x64 drivers.

### 2. DSN

Set up DSN for your remote postgres database with ODBC Data Source Administrator.
currently take x64 and UNICODE.

### - trying SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, but it was a mistake =)
(and you don't need to wotk with ProviderDescriptors.xml)

### 3. Data Sources in SSIS

SSIS have connections to ODBC too, it is hide in "Other Sources" menu

# Convert PostgreSQL to MS SQL Server

1. http://www.sqlines.com/online

2. Currently comment all complex things, such as nextval(regclass)

3. Problems:

### Unicode vs ANSI
1. go to Advanced edit, fix Output datatypes
2. create recipient table with appropriate unicode type

### Truncation
make right length to sender and to recipient
I find max size of strings in appropriate column and set 1.5x to DT_WSTR size. 

### Row by Row because of LOB

remove DT_NEXT where you don't need it
